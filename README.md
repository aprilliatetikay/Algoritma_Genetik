🧬 Genetic Algorithm (Algoritma Genetik) - README

📌 1. Project Description

This project explores Genetic Algorithms (GA), a powerful optimization technique inspired by natural selection. The goal is to understand and implement GA for solving optimization problems using Python.

The project includes:

✅ An introduction to Genetic Algorithms.

✅ Implementing selection, crossover, and mutation.

✅ Running the algorithm to find optimal solutions.

✅ Using Python to visualize and analyze results.

🧪 2. Concept of Genetic Algorithm

🔹 How Genetic Algorithm Works:

Initialization: Generate a population of candidate solutions.

Selection: Choose the fittest individuals based on a fitness function.

Crossover (Recombination): Combine two parents to create offspring.

Mutation: Introduce small changes to maintain diversity.

Evaluation: Compute the fitness of new individuals.

Termination: Stop when an optimal solution is found or after a set number of generations.

🔹 Why Use Genetic Algorithm?

Suitable for complex optimization problems.

Can handle non-linear search spaces.

Finds global optima while avoiding local optima traps.

🛠️ 3. Implementation in Jupyter Notebook

The notebook (Algoritma_Genetik.ipynb) implements a Genetic Algorithm step-by-step, including:

Defining a fitness function to evaluate individuals.

Implementing selection methods (e.g., Roulette Wheel, Tournament Selection).

Performing crossover to combine genetic information.

Applying mutation to introduce variations.

Running GA for multiple generations to find the optimal solution.

## 🧪 Concept of Genetic Algorithm

### 🔹 How Genetic Algorithm Works:
1. **Initialization** → Generate an initial population of candidate solutions.
2. **Selection** → Choose the fittest individuals based on a fitness function.
3. **Crossover (Recombination)** → Combine two parents to create offspring.
4. **Mutation** → Introduce small changes to maintain diversity.
5. **Evaluation** → Compute the fitness of new individuals.
6. **Termination** → Stop when an optimal solution is found or after a set number of generations.

### 🔹 Why Use Genetic Algorithms?

✅ Suitable for **complex optimization problems**.

✅ Handles **non-linear search spaces** effectively.

✅ Finds **global optima** while avoiding local optima traps.
